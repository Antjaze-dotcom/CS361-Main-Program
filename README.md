# Wrathful Warlocks - Turn-Based Strategy Game (Python, Tkinter)

Wrathful Warlocks is a turn-based strategy game in the same vein as Stratego, chess, and checkers. 
It is currently being built in Python using Tkinter as part of Oregon State University coursework.
The project focuses on on object-oreiented design, event-driven UI development and game-state management.

This repository contains the full game logic, UI flow, and supporting classes used to run the game.

## Features:

- Multi-screen Tkinter GUI with dynamic page navigation
- Event driven player interaction (buttons, menus, and setup flow)
- Turn based game loop with centralized game state management
- Object oriented design for game entities (pawns, units, and board state)
- Modular architecture seperating UI, game logic, and data models

## Technologies:

   - Python
   - Tkinter
   - Object-Orieneted Design
   - Event-Driven Programming
   - Git/ GitHub

## How to Run:

  1. Clone repository
  2. Run the main entry file for GUI navigation: Main_App.py
  3. For command based navigation, go to game logic file, FantasyGame.py, and run: WrathfulWarlocks = FantasyGame()

## Educational Context:

  This project was developed as part of courseowrk at Oregon State University.
  The design, implementation, and documantation are my own work.
